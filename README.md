Premier League analysis and FPL (Fanstasy Premier League) autonomous agent project.

## Objectives

### FPL

Build, train and test an autonomous agent whose primary goal is to maximise FPL points return over an entire season of FPL play.
This should achievable by leveraging a large dataset of past gameweek player performances and scripts that allow a specific manager's season data to be downloaded and stored in `.csv` format (credit to [Vaastav Anand](https://github.com/vaastav) for this work.)
